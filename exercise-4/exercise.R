# Install Plotly 


# Use the plot_ly function to test it out and see that it is working
# create a variable and pass in the plot_ly function that takes in 
# the data midwest, sets the x to ~percollege, the color to ~state 
# and the type to "box" 


# Make two vectors of numbers between 1 and 10, with each vector having 10 numbers in it


# create a data frame of the two vectors 


# now create a basic scatterplot using the data frame you just created, passing it into 
# a variable


# Call your variable and enjoy your awesome plot! 


# Now create a new variable styled.scatterplot. Using the same data and scatterplot
# as from earlier, but you are going to change the markers.  Make it so the 
# markers are size 10, of a color of your choice.  Finally change the boarder,
# of the markers to a differnet color with a widthe of 2


# Call the style.scatterplot variable and see what has changed. Finally add
# add a pipe operator and use the layout function to add a title and set the
# x and y axis to have zeroline = FALSE
